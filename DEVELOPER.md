Contributing to the CLI
====

Please read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/abraham/nutmeg-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code of conduct](https://github.com/abraham/nutmeg-cli/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

🔽 Install
----

Fork the [abraham/nutmeg-cli](https://github.com/abraham/nutmeg-cli) project to your own GitHub profile. Clone the fork to your local machine replacing `abraham` with your GitHub handle.

```
git clone git@github.com:abraham/nutmeg-cli.git
```

Within the `nutmeg-cli` run `npm install` to install the development dependancies.

To make the development CLI available locally on your machine run `npm install --global` from within `nutmeg-cli` to make this development version available as `nutmeg`.

🚧  **Be sure to run `npm install --global @nutmeg/cli` after you are done developing to go back to stable.**


🌱 Code
----

Check out a new Git branch to start working on with `git checkout -b useful-feature`.

Have `npm run watch` in a terminal window. This will watch for changes to the code and rebuild `dist` as needed. You can now make changes to the `src` and `template-element` files as desired and try out those changes.

🔼 Contribute
----

Once you are happy with your changes commit them to Git with a short but descriptive message.

```
git commit -m 'Added useful feature'
```

Push the branch to your GitHub fork and create a [pull request](https://github.com/abraham/nutmeg-cli/pulls) to abraham/nutmeg-cli.

📁 Files
----

* `src` - TypeScript files that make up the logic of the CLI. This is where most of the work gets done.
* `dist` - Compiled version of the code that actually gets shipped and run. This is automatically generated by Webpack and should not be manually changed.
* `bin` - The executable stubs that NPM registers on the installed machine and loads the working code from `dist`.
* `element-template` - This is a directory of template files that get compiled and output as the product of running `nutmeg new hello-world`. These are what should get changed to effect the generated Web Components.
